#**Discord!**

In case you (somehow) missed it, I made a [Discord server] (https://discord.gg/0wI3FYLsfF0WqlGm) for us all to talk to each other on, with channels for a whole variety of subjects. [Here’s an FAQ created several months ago] (https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/4e9fr2/what_are_your_commute_observations_110416/d1y6ol1) if you’d like more information. It now has “500” members and counting, but it does feel very homely, so don’t be shy! :)

#**Spotify!**

Here’s your reminder that /u/lodge28 created a Spotify playlist of Tune of the Day songs, which you can see [here] (https://open.spotify.com/user/lodge28/playlist/5DkM5SftFz1AOa0LlLbFqN)! In case you’re wondering, I don’t include Tunes of the Day because I’m an edgy EDM-liking teenager – my suggestion, though, is just play the playlist on shuffle. :)
